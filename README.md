### Conquering Responsive Layouts - Final Project

Welcome to the "Conquering Responsive Layouts" final project! This website was created as the culmination of the course led by Kevin Powell. Below, you'll find information about the project, its structure, and the technologies used.

## Project Description

The project is the result of a course aimed at acquiring skills in designing responsive web layouts. The entire website was built from scratch based on the provided sketch, but I made some modifications to improve content perception. I adjusted the texts to make the page more engaging and understandable for users.

## Technologies

The website was built using the following technologies:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
SASS Preprocessor
BEM Methodology (Block Element Modifier)

## Additional Information

Throughout the project, I adhered to the principles of HTML semantics and the BEM methodology to maintain code clarity and ease of maintenance. I hope the website meets expectations and is enjoyable to use!
